# Debug Data

- Debug is a special category in Pinecil that is usually hidden and not used unless tracing an issue.
- On Pinecil, the debug menu is accessed by long hold ++minus++ and then using the ++plus++ to scroll through the values.
- PineSAM currently displays the raw values as sent by the Pinecil and does no change to the values; therefore, these may not match exactly what you see on the Pinecil Debug screen.
- Not all values are available yet; go to Pinecil directly to see all items.
- Complete Debug functions are detailed in [Ralim's IronOS here](https://ralim.github.io/IronOS/DebugMenu/).
