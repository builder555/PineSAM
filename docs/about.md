# Contribute & Support

## :simple-githubsponsors:{ .githubsponsors } [Sponsor PineSAM](https://github.com/sponsors/builder555)

If you find the project useful, then consider sponsoring what you can, even a cup of coffee to get through debugging a new feature.

## :material-alien-outline: Bug Reports

1. Try to read the documents and search the issue tracker to find answers before posting a new issue.
2. Follow the template in the issue ticket and include all details requested.
3. Be prepared to answer questions or give additional information. Issues where the creator does not follow up to questions will be marked stale and closed.

## :material-chat-question-outline: Issue Tickets

Help answer questions in issue tickets. Share your experience to help others by offering suggestions and solutions in issues.

## :octicons-beaker-16: Test Features

Test features on different devices and systems. Report on items not working as intended, or help debug and diagnose issues.

## :material-file-edit-outline: Improve Documents

If the documents are lacking or there is a typo, consider improving it or open an issue ticket if you are not comfortable digging into a full Github Pull Request. Translating PineSAM into different languages is another way to help.

## :material-eye-refresh-outline: Review Code

Make suggestions that improve code, error handling, and algorithms. Participate in code review of pull requests and direct commits.

## :material-source-pull: Pull Requests

Code contributions are welcome. Just fork the code and submit well commented and clean commits to the repository. Perform a pull pequests (pr) to the **/dev** branch. Check out some of the open issue tickets or propose new features. If there is no existing ticket related to the PR, then create a ticket outlining what issues are being addressed.
