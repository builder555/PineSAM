# Usage

1. Click on PineSAM logo to reveal the unique BLE name of your Pinecil.
2. Update available notice appears under the PineSAM logo if a new release is available for download.
3. PineSAM version number is next to the Github Cat in the top right of the screen.
4. Clicking on the waving cat links to the main Github PineSAM repo.
5. Show Hints: toggles on/off to display help messages from Pinecil and PineSAM.
6. Temperature automatically adjusts based on °C or °F setting.
7. Colors are designed to work in Light or Dark view mode on PC and Phone Browsers.
8. Thermostat icon changes into 100 different color hues as the live temperature changes.

## Save Changes to Flash

- In Work HUD view, leave Save to Flash OFF (not needed and preserves flash cycles).
- Toggle this on ''only'' before changing settings on the Pinecil so they persist on reboot.

### Steps to Change Settings:

1. toggle on the Save to Flash (grey is off)
2. change all desired settings
3. once complete, toggle it off.
4. if using the Work HUD view, it is best to leave this off. No reason to constantly flash to pinecil for each temperature change (don't worry Pinecil still changes temperature, it's just not permanently flashed and set).
